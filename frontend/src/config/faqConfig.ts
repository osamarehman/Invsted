      "invstED is not a nonprofit. We are a registered social enterprise. We made a deliberate decision to incorporate as a social enterprise and not a charity or nonprofit. Our mission is to ensure that every student, no matter their socioeconomic status, has the resources to reach their fullest potential. To achieve this, we need to be able to reach our fullest potential. Being a social enterprise enables us to grow while also securing our long-term future and ability to continue serving students. Large societal problems, such as educational equity, require significant monetary investments to solve, especially as we leverage the technology to do so through our platform. By choosing to be a social enterprise instead of a nonprofit/charity, we have the safeguards we need to achieve our mission while not limiting the size of our potential impact.",

This allowed us to identify and address issues before we continue to scale. If you are an investor, you are welcome to sign up and invest in a student in the pilot group. If you are a student, you can sign up for the waitlist and we will reach out when we expand the pilot.",

      "While giving to students on our platform is a donation, we consider those who give so much more than donors.

Thus, the return on investment is not financial, but instead emotional. You as an investor get to see a student’s success and progress up close, through regular updates and newsletters, and know that you were a critical part of making that happen. ",

      "When you give to an invstED student, you as an investor have the power to choose how you give, how much, and how often. If you want to donate one time, or on a recurring basis, if you want to allocate money to buy someone lunch, or actually buy them a new pair of shoes that they need, you get to make that choice. In addition, when you give, you get to see the short-term impact of your giving (such as buying a hungry student lunch) but you also get to build a connection that will allow you to see the long-term impact of your giving (such as when a student graduates or gets a job), knowing you were a critical part of their success.

      "When it comes to combating poverty, money comes before anything else. A teacher could be world-class, but if a student is hungry, they won’t be able to learn. That is why we start with financial investment, but we know that is just a start. We also know our investors have so much more to give than just money, such as time, advice, mentoring and networking. If you are interested in providing more to the students you donate to, please reach out directly to questions@invsted.org with the name of the student you are investing in and what else you would like to offer.",

We want to lower the barriers students face to getting help, but we also know you want to trust who you are giving your money to. We also recognise that everyone's circumstances are different, and that household income or student loans can be a poor proxy for a person's individual needs. Because of this, the only thing we require from students is that they use their official university email address. This ensures that they are a student at their institution. Beyond that, we give students the option to upload additional verification (such as FAFSAs, transcripts, bursary proof etc.) but we don't require it.  ",

    title: "What are your safety and security protocols?",
    content: `At invstED, the safety and security of our students has been a top priority since Day 1. As someone who comes from a low-income background, including homelessness and food insecurity, our CEO Brianna Goodlin acutely understands the vulnerable place our students are in, and we prioritize their protection and safety in everything we do.

        This includes:
        - No identifying information shared publicly; each student chooses what to share
        - Investors must register and verify their profiles before they can browse and begin investing in students
        - There is no direct messaging between students & investors. All communication is one-way, monitored by our team, and restricted solely to the platform
        
        If you have additional questions about safety or security, please reach out to us directly at security@invsted.org`,

They want you to be successful and want to help provide the resources that will ensure that. Thus, what you “owe” investors is your own success. You will be asked to share exciting updates and accomplishments with your investors through biannual “newsletters”, but these are more an opportunity to highlight what you have achieved and how you are doing.",

Students then must complete a short budgeting exercise for your profile to go live. Once up, you can share your profile with your network, get discovered by our network, and start receiving investment. You are also given the option of uploading additional documents for further verification (such as transcripts, FAFSA, etc.) though these are not required.",

This is the point of community. It’s the reason why who you know, and not what you know, makes the difference. It’s the reason why it is so much easier for some than for others to beat the odds. It’s the reason why some people get great jobs off the bat or investments for their new business venture. This is what we are building for you, and it consists not only of investors but also the people around you on this platform.",
