To achieve this, we need to be able to reach our fullest potential. Being a social enterprise enables us to grow while also securing our long-term future and ability to continue serving students. Large societal problems, such as educational equity, require significant monetary investments to solve, especially as we leverage the technology to do so through our platform. By choosing to be a social enterprise instead of a nonprofit/charity, we have the safeguards we need to achieve our mission while not limiting the size of our potential impact.",

      legally responsible for the use of your information in connection with those projects.
      
      invstED Ltd (we, our or us) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

      This policy explains why and how we will use the personal information that we have obtained from you or others, with whom we

    title: "6. Our use of social media",
    content: `We use social media platforms in a variety of different ways, including by publishing pages through which you can interact, running competitions or advertising to you using information you have provided those platforms or which has been provided by us or collected from this Site.  Our legal relationship with each platform varies with the particular way we use that platform.

      We process your personal information using social media platforms in a variety of ways, as follows:
      
      Pages. We use your personal information when you post content or otherwise interact with us on our official pages Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social media platforms. We also use the Page Insights service for Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn to view statistical information and reports regarding your interactions with the pages we administer on those platforms and their content.  Where those interactions are recorded and form part of the information we access through the Page Insights services, we and the relevant platform are joint controllers of the processing necessary to provide that service to us.
      
      Single sign-on. Our Site incorporates a feature provided by social media and other digital service providers that allows you to log into your account on this Site using the same login you have already set up with those providers. This feature is known as a ‘single sign-on service’.  Any use we make of the personal information we receive from the platform using this feature is processing for which we are the sole controller.
      
      Data from your profile. When you use single sign-on services, you will be prompted to confirm that you are happy to share with us your email address and certain other personal information you hold with those providers.  You may be asked if you would like to share information with us that goes beyond what is needed to log you into your account on our Site. For example, you may be asked if you would like us to use your contact details or date of birth for direct marketing purposes. We will only use your personal information in this way if you agree.
      
      Targeted advertising. We use social media platforms (as well as search engines and third party websites and other platforms) to deliver targeted advertising to you via those platforms, unless you object.  You may receive advertising because you have previously interacted with us (such as by visiting one of our Sites) or because of your profile on a social media platform on which you have an account. You can find our more by consulting the help pages of the relevant social media platform but in summary we use social media platforms to send targeted advertising using two main methods:
      
      ‘Custom audience’ targeting.  You may receive advertising based on information about you that we have provided to the platform or allowed it to collect using cookies/pixels or code embedded in our Site (or a combination of the two).  For example, we may target you if you have signed up to our mailing list and where cookies have detected that you have visited our Site in the last month.  Please see the paragraph below regarding our use of cookies to send targeted advertising using social media.
      
      ‘Lookalike audience’ targeting.You may also receive advertising because, at our request,  the social media platform has identified you as falling within a group or ‘audience’ whose attributes we have selected, or a group that has similar attributes to you (or a combination of the two).
      
      Cookies.We use cookies and similar technologies in this Site to collect and send information to Facebook (who operates the Facebook and Instagram platforms) and LinkedIn about actions you take on this Site. In particular, Facebook (who operates the Facebook and Instagram platforms) uses this information to provide services to us and also for further processing for its own business purposes.  We and Facebook are joint controllers of the processing involved in collecting and sending your personal information to Facebook using cookies and similar technologies as each of us has a business interest in Facebook receiving this information.  
      
       You can find out more about these technologies by visiting our Cookie Policy.  The services we receive from Facebook that use this information are delivered to us through Facebook’s Business Tools, which include Facebook Login (Facebook’s single sign-on service, see above), Facebook Pixel and Website Custom Audiences (which includes ‘lookalike audience’ targeting).  The data from these tools allows us to target advertising to you within Facebook’s social media platform by creating audiences based on your actions on our website and applications. They also allow Facebook to improve and optimise the targeting and delivery of our advertising campaigns for us.  Please see the paragraph above for further information.
      
      We use LinkedIn Insight Tag, a small piece of code that we embed in this Site that allows us to perform in-depth campaign reporting and unlock insights about users that may visit this Site via our LinkedIn campaigns (e.g. by allowing us to discover business demographics by layering LinkedIn data on data about our Site’s visitors).  LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of metadata such as IP addresses, timestamps, and events such as page views.  You can find out more about these technologies by visiting our Cookie Policy.
      
      Our relationship with social media platforms.
      As we are joint controllers/controllers with these platforms for certain processing, we and each platform have taken some or all of the following steps, depending on the platform:
      - entered into agreements in which we have agreed each of our data protection responsibilities for the processing of your personal information described above;
      - agreed that we are responsible for providing to you the information in this privacy statement about our relationship with each platform; and
      - agreed that each platform is responsible for responding to you when you exercise your rights under data protection law in relation to that platform’s processing of your personal information as a joint controller.
      
      Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter also process, as our processors, personal information that we submit for the purposes of matching, online targeting, measurement, reporting and analytics purposes.  These services include the processing these platforms carry out when they display our advertisements to you in your social media feed at our request after matching contact details for you that we have uploaded to them.  These advertisements may include forms through which we collect contact information you give to us.
      
      Further information.

    title: "7. Transfers of your personal information outside of Europe",
    content: `All the personal information collected about you by us or on our behalf may be transferred to countries outside the United Kingdom (UK) European Economic Area (EEA). By way of example, this may happen where any of our suppliers are located in a country outside of the UK and EEA or if any of our servers or those of our third party service providers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EEA. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK and so they may not protect the use of your personal information to the same extent.

      If we transfer your information outside of the UK and EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy. These steps include imposing contractual obligations on the recipients of your personal information or ensuring that the recipients are subscribed to ‘international frameworks’ that aim to ensure adequate protection.   Please contact us using the details at the end of this policy for more information about the protections that we put in place.
      
      If you use our services whilst you are outside the UK and EEA, your information may be transferred outside the UK and EEA in order to provide you with those services.`,

    content: `We take the security of your personal information seriously and use a variety of measures based on good industry practice to keep it secure. Nonetheless, transmissions over the internet and to our Site may not be completely secure, so please exercise caution. When accessing links to other websites, their privacy policies, not ours, will apply to your personal information.

      We employ security measures to protect the personal information you provide to us, to prevent access by unauthorised persons and unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. When we have provided (or you have chosen) a password or pin allowing you access to certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for safeguarding it and keeping it confidential and you promise not to allow it to be used by third parties. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do everything possible to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information during its transmission to us online. You accept the inherent security implications of using the internet and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless we are at fault.
      
      Our Site and social media pages may contain links to other websites run by other organisations which we do not control. This policy does not apply to those other websites‚ so we encourage you to read their privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites (even if you access them using links that we provide) and we provide links to those websites solely for your information and convenience. We specifically disclaim responsibility for their content, privacy practices and terms of use, and we make no endorsements, representations or promises about their accuracy, content or thoroughness. Your disclosure of personal information to third party websites is at your own risk.
      
      In addition, if you linked to our Site from a third party website, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners and operators of that third party website and recommend that you check the policy of that third party website.`,

    title: "10. Your rights in relation to your personal information",
    content: `You have a number of rights in relation to your personal information under data protection law. In relation to certain rights, we may ask you for information to verify your identity and, where applicable, to help us to search for your personal information. Except in rare cases, we will respond to you within 30 days after we have received this information or, where no such information is required, after we have received full details of your request.  You have the following rights, some of which may only apply in certain circumstances:

      10.1. To be informed about the processing of your personal information (this is what this policy sets out to do)

      10.6. To have your personal information erased
      
      In certain circumstances, you may ask for your personal information to be removed from our systems by emailing or writing to us at the address at the end of this policy.

We will provide this to you electronically in a structured, commonly used and machine readable form, such as a CSV file.
